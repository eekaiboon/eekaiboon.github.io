# Testing Locally

To test the website on your local machine, you can set up a simple HTTP server. Here's how you can do it:

## Starting the Server

1. **Launch the HTTP Server:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```

   This will start a local web server on port 8000.

2. **Accessing the Website:**
   Once the server is running, you can view the website by visiting:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

   in your web browser. Navigate to the specific HTML file you wish to view.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system to use the `python3 -m http.server` command.
- If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements, refer to the official Python documentation for setting up a local HTTP server.
