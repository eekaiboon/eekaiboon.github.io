                        <p>
                            I'm currently navigating the tech world as a Staff Software Engineer at Brex, riding a wave
                            of over 10 years in the industry. My journey has taken me through innovative startups like
                            Chronicle Inc and Brex, as well as tech giants such as Google and Bloomberg.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the realm of backend engineering, my passion lies in creating scalable and reliable
                            systems, always with an eye toward products that truly delight our customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond the nuts and bolts of coding and system design, I find real joy in leading and
                            mentoring engineering teams. Whether I'm in the trenches as an individual contributor or
                            steering the ship as a manager, I relish the opportunity to delve into the nuances of team
                            dynamics and leadership. It's all about creating an environment where everyone can thrive
                            and excel.

                            blog posts, and a showcase of my projects. Whether you're here for a bit of professional
                            insight, or just curious about what makes me tick, I'm genuinely excited to share my world
